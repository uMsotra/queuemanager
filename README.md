I'm thinking of implementing notifications differently because automated emails are often put in spam and customers wont see it.
I was thinking whatsapp, but mos of the api or all are paid
Now I'm thinking of notifying user on the browser, but how? I'm thinking...
I really don't want to authenticate users, this is just simple queue joining
